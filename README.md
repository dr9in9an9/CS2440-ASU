Hello human!

This is my code dump from my Computer Science 2 class at Appalachian State University. 

I retook this class for a better grade and a more solid understanding of the material. 

That being said, I took two different lab finals. Each lab final session there are 2 lab finals assigned, either A or B. 

The prompts were very different for the lab final session in the summer compared the spring. I am sure this is the same case for the fall session.

.

My code does NOT give you a 100% completion grade. Please modify the code accordingly.

The following are the coverage percentages:

01 - 100%

02 - 73.0%

03 - 100%

04 - 100%

05 - 94.4%

06 - 98.2%

07 - 98.1%

08 - 93.4%

09 - 87.5%

10 - 100%

SpringLabFinal - 100%

SummerLabFinal - 100%
